# Project-2-Interactive-Experience
This is an interactive experience fueled by randomness.
My thought process was for users to be looking through a window and each pane of thw window leads you to a new wacky experience.
There are images in this project that are from the public domain and edited to be fun and weird.
I really wanted this project to make no sense and be confusing as to what exactly is happening.
